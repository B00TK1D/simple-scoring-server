# Simple Scoring Server

Provides basic functionality with ability to generate and implant new flags on a variety of services using plug-in modules.

Also provides a simple web interface for viewing which flags have been compromised and which have not, and a place to submit flags.

Uses config.json for configuration, including list of red and blue boxes and their services, and associated modules for each service.
